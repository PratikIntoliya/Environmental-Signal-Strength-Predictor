# Environmental-Signal-Strength-Predictor
This project uses a deep learning model to classify different types of wireless signals (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE) based on their signal characteristics. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains signal samples for each type of wireless signal, including features such as weather conditions and location. The dataset was preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize the input data.
